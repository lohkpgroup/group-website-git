              </strong></p>
              <p>Layer-by-layer stacked chemical vapor deposition graphene films find applications as transparent and conductive electrodes in solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes and touch panels. Common to lamellar type systems with anisotropic electron delocalization, the plane-to-plane (vertical) conductivity in such systems is several orders lower than its in-plane conductivity. The poor electronic coupling between the planes is due to the presence of transfer-process organic residues and trapped air pocket in wrinkles. Here, we show the plane-to-plane tunneling conductivity of stacked CVD graphene layers can be improved significantly by inserting 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester between the graphene layers. The 6 orders of magnitude increase in plane-to-plane conductivity is due to hole doping, orbital hybridization, planarization and the exclusion of polymer residues. Our results highlight the importance of interfacial modification for enhancing the performance of LBL stacked CVD graphene films, which should be applicable to other types of stacked two dimensional films.</p></td>

              <p> High-fidelity transfer or direct growth of high-quality graphene  films on arbitrary substrates is needed to enable wide-ranging applications in  photonics or electronics, which include devices such as optoelectronic  modulators, transistors, on-chip biosensors and tunnelling barriers. The direct  growth of graphene film on an insulating substrate, such as a SiO2/Si wafer,  would be useful for this purpose, but current research efforts remain grounded  at the proof-of-concept stage, where only discontinuous, nanometre-sized  islands can be obtained. Here we develop a face-to-face transfer method for  wafer-scale graphene films that is so far the only known way to accomplish both  the growth and transfer steps on one wafer. This spontaneous transfer method  relies on nascent gas bubbles and capillary bridges between the graphene film  and the underlying substrate during etching of the metal catalyst, which is  analogous to the method used by tree frogs to remain attached to submerged  leaves. In contrast to the previous wet or dry transfer results, the  face-to-face transfer does not have to be done by hand and is compatible with  any size and shape of substrate; this approach also enjoys the benefit of a  much reduced density of transfer defects compared with the conventional  transfer method. Most importantly, the direct growth and spontaneous attachment  of graphene on the underlying substrate is amenable to batch processing in a  semiconductor production line, and thus will speed up the technological  application of graphene.</p></td>

            <p>Graphene oxide, a two-dimensional aromatic scaffold decorated by oxygen-containing functional groups, possesses rich chemical properties and may present a green alternative to precious metal catalysts. Graphene oxide-based carbocatalysis has recently been demonstrated for aerobic oxidative reactions. However, its widespread application is hindered by the need for high catalyst loadings. Here we report a simple chemical treatment that can create and enlarge the defects in graphene oxide and impart on it enhanced catalytic activities for the oxidative coupling of amines to imines (up to 98% yield at 5 wt% catalyst loading, under solvent-free, open-air conditions). This study examines the origin of the enhanced catalytic activity, which can be linked to the synergistic effect of carboxylic acid groups and unpaired electrons at the edge defects. The discovery of a simple chemical processing step to synthesize highly active graphene oxide allows the premise of industrial-scale carbocatalysis to be explored.</p></td>

However, the bottleneck for strain engineering in graphene has been the ability to control such strain patterns at the nanoscale. Here we show that high level of control can be accomplished by chemically modifying the adherence of graphene on metal. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, the shape evolution of graphene Moir&eacute; blisters towards geometrically well-defined graphene bubbles was studied during the controlled, sub-layer oxidation of the ruthenium substrate. Understanding the dynamics of the oxidation process and defects generation on the Ru substrate allows us to control the size, shape and the density of the bubbles and its associated pseudo-magnetism. We also show that a modification of the same procedure can be used to create antidots in graphene by catalytic reaction of the same nanobubbles.</p></td>

These polarizing components are not easily integrated with photonic circuits. The in-line fibre polarizer, which relies on polarization-selective coupling between the evanescent field and birefringent crystal or metal, is a promising alternative because of its compatibility with most fibre-optic systems. Here, we demonstrate the operation of a broadband fibre polarizer based on graphene, an ultrathin two-dimensional carbon material. The out-coupled light in the telecommunication band shows a strong s-polarization effect with an extinction ratio of 27 dB. Unlike polarizers made from thin metal film, a graphene polarizer can support transverse-electric-mode surface wave propagation due to its linear dispersion of Dirac electrons.</p></td>
