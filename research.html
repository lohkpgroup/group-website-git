            <p data-test="article-title" data-article-title="" itemprop="name headline">Coupling spins of molecular magnets to two-dimensional (2D) materials provides a framework to manipulate the magneto-conductance of 2D materials. However, with most molecules, the spin coupling is usually weak and devices fabricated from these require operation at low temperatures, which prevents practical applications. Here, we demonstrate field-effect transistors based on the coupling of a magnetic molecule quinoidal dithienyl perylenequinodimethane (QDTP) to 2D materials. Uniquely, QDTP switches from a spin-singlet state at low temperature to a spin-triplet state above 370 K, and the spin transition can be electrically transduced by both graphene and molybdenum disulphide. Graphene-QDTP shows hole-doping and a large positive magnetoresistance ( ~ 50%), while molybdenum disulphide-QDTP demonstrates electron-doping and a switch to large negative magnetoresistance ( ~ 100%) above the magnetic transition. Our work shows the promise of spin detection at high temperature by coupling 2D materials and molecular magnets.</p></td>

            <p>Even though organic molecules with well-designed  functional groups can be programmed to have high electron density per unit  mass, their poor electrical conductivity and low cycle stability limit their  applications in batteries. A team led by Prof Loh Kian Ping report the facile  synthesis of &pi;-conjugated quinoxaline-based heteroaromatic molecules (3Q) by  condensation of cyclic carbonyl molecules with o-phenylenediamine. 3Q features  a number of electron-deficient pyrazine sites, where multiple redox reactions  take place, which was probed using in-situ 15N and 13C solid state Nuclear  Magnetic Resonance. When hybridized with graphene and coupled with an  ether-based electrolyte, an organic cathode based on 3Q molecules displays a  discharge capacity of 395 mAh g&minus;1 at 400 mA g&minus;1 (1C) in the voltage range of  1.2&ndash;3.9 V and a nearly 70% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 8 A g&minus;1.  This work is important in demonstrating that heteroaromatic molecules with  multiple redox sites are promising in developing high-energy-density,  long-cycle-life organic rechargeable batteries.</p></td>

            <p>The synthesis of crystalline two-dimensional (2D)  conjugated polymers with well-defined repeating units and porosity presents  complex challenges to synthetic chemists. Here we report a crystalline 2D  conjugated aromatic polymer (2D-CAP) synthesized via C-C coupling reactions.  Scanning tunneling microscopy study reveals that C-C coupling among 2-TBQP  monomers on Au(111) generates 2D-CAP and its one-dimensional analogue.  Interestingly, the pre-arranged 2-TBQP monomers in its crystals undergo C-C  coupling driven endogenous solid-state polymerization to produce crystalline  2D-CAP. 2D-CAP can be mechanically exfoliated into micrometer-sized lamellar  sheets with a thickness of 1nm. Gas sorption isothermal measurements of bulk  2D-CAP reveal a dominant pore size of ~0.6 nm, indicating uniform open channels  from the eclipsed stacking of 2D-CAP sheets. 2D-CAP allows fast  charge/discharge of sodium ions when employed as an organic anode in an ambient  temperature sodium cell. It gives a reversible capacity of 114 mAh g-1 at a  high current density of 5.0 A g-1 and retains 70% of its capacity after 7700  cycles.</p></td>

            <p>Interface confined reactions, which can modulate the bonding of reactants with catalytic centres and influence the rate of the mass transport from bulk solution, have emerged as a viable strategy for achieving highly stable and selective catalysis. Here we demonstrate that 1T&prime;-enriched lithiated molybdenum disulfide is a highly powerful reducing agent, which can be exploited for the&nbsp;<em>in-situ</em>&nbsp;reduction of metal ions within the inner planes of lithiated molybdenum disulfide to form a zero valent metal-intercalated molybdenum disulfide. The confinement of platinum nanoparticles within the molybdenum disulfide layered structure leads to enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction activity and stability compared to catalysts dispersed on carbon support. In particular, the inner platinum surface is accessible to charged species like proton and metal ions, while blocking poisoning by larger sized pollutants or neutral molecules. This points a way forward for using bulk intercalated compounds for energy related applications.</p></td>

            <p data-article-title="" itemprop="name headline">Reducing the dimensionality of transition metal dichalcogenides to one dimension opens it to structural and electronic modulation related to charge density wave and quantum correlation effects arising from edge states. The greater flexibility of a molecular scale nanowire allows a strain-imposing substrate to exert structural and electronic modulation on it, leading to an interplay between the curvature-induced influences and intrinsic ground-state topology. Herein, the templated growth of MoS2&nbsp;nanowire arrays consisting of the smallest stoichiometric MoS2building blocks is investigated using scanning tunnelling microscopy and non-contact atomic force microscopy. Our results show that lattice strain imposed on a nanowire causes the energy of the edge states to oscillate periodically along its length in phase with the period of the substrate topographical modulation. This periodic oscillation vanishes when individual MoS2&nbsp;nanowires join to form a wider nanoribbon, revealing that the strain-induced modulation depends on in-plane rigidity, which increases with system size.</p></td>

            <p>By studying 1T-TiSe2&nbsp;single crystals with thicknesses of 10 nanometres or less, encapsulated in two-dimensional layers of hexagonal boron nitride, we achieve unprecedented control over the CDW transition temperature (tuned from 170 kelvin to 40 kelvin), and over the superconductivity transition temperature (tuned from a quantum critical point at 0 kelvin up to 3 kelvin). Electrically driving TiSe2&nbsp;over different ordered electronic phases allows us to study the details of the phase transitions between many-body states. Observations of periodic oscillations of magnetoresistance induced by the Little&ndash;Parks effect show that the appearance of superconductivity is directly correlated with the spatial texturing of the amplitude and phase of the superconductivity order parameter, corresponding to a two-dimensional matrix of superconductivity. We infer that this superconductivity matrix is supported by a matrix of incommensurate CDW states embedded in the commensurate CDW states. Our results show that spatially modulated electronic states are fundamental to the appearance of two-dimensional superconductivity.</p></td>

              <p>Layer-by-layer stacked chemical vapor deposition graphene films find applications as transparent and conductive electrodes in solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes and touch panels. Common to lamellar type systems with anisotropic electron delocalization, the plane-to-plane (vertical) conductivity in such systems is several orders lower than its in-plane conductivity. The poor electronic coupling between the planes is due to the presence of transfer-process organic residues and trapped air pocket in wrinkles. Here, we show the plane-to-plane tunneling conductivity of stacked CVD graphene layers can be improved significantly by inserting 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester between the graphene layers. The 6 orders of magnitude increase in plane-to-plane conductivity is due to hole doping, orbital hybridization, planarization and the exclusion of polymer residues. Our results highlight the importance of interfacial modification for enhancing the performance of LBL stacked CVD graphene films, which should be applicable to other types of stacked two dimensional films.</p></td>

              <p> High-fidelity transfer or direct growth of high-quality graphene  films on arbitrary substrates is needed to enable wide-ranging applications in  photonics or electronics, which include devices such as optoelectronic  modulators, transistors, on-chip biosensors and tunnelling barriers. The direct  growth of graphene film on an insulating substrate, such as a SiO2/Si wafer,  would be useful for this purpose, but current research efforts remain grounded  at the proof-of-concept stage, where only discontinuous, nanometre-sized  islands can be obtained. Here we develop a face-to-face transfer method for  wafer-scale graphene films that is so far the only known way to accomplish both  the growth and transfer steps on one wafer. This spontaneous transfer method  relies on nascent gas bubbles and capillary bridges between the graphene film  and the underlying substrate during etching of the metal catalyst, which is  analogous to the method used by tree frogs to remain attached to submerged  leaves. In contrast to the previous wet or dry transfer results, the  face-to-face transfer does not have to be done by hand and is compatible with  any size and shape of substrate; this approach also enjoys the benefit of a  much reduced density of transfer defects compared with the conventional  transfer method. Most importantly, the direct growth and spontaneous attachment  of graphene on the underlying substrate is amenable to batch processing in a  semiconductor production line, and thus will speed up the technological  application of graphene.</p></td>

            <p>Graphene oxide, a two-dimensional aromatic scaffold decorated by oxygen-containing functional groups, possesses rich chemical properties and may present a green alternative to precious metal catalysts. Graphene oxide-based carbocatalysis has recently been demonstrated for aerobic oxidative reactions. However, its widespread application is hindered by the need for high catalyst loadings. Here we report a simple chemical treatment that can create and enlarge the defects in graphene oxide and impart on it enhanced catalytic activities for the oxidative coupling of amines to imines (up to 98% yield at 5 wt% catalyst loading, under solvent-free, open-air conditions). This study examines the origin of the enhanced catalytic activity, which can be linked to the synergistic effect of carboxylic acid groups and unpaired electrons at the edge defects. The discovery of a simple chemical processing step to synthesize highly active graphene oxide allows the premise of industrial-scale carbocatalysis to be explored.</p></td>

            <p>Strain engineering has been proposed as an alternative method for manipulating the electronic properties of graphene. However, the bottleneck for strain engineering in graphene has been the ability to control such strain patterns at the nanoscale. Here we show that high level of control can be accomplished by chemically modifying the adherence of graphene on metal. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, the shape evolution of graphene Moir&eacute; blisters towards geometrically well-defined graphene bubbles was studied during the controlled, sub-layer oxidation of the ruthenium substrate. Understanding the dynamics of the oxidation process and defects generation on the Ru substrate allows us to control the size, shape and the density of the bubbles and its associated pseudo-magnetism. We also show that a modification of the same procedure can be used to create antidots in graphene by catalytic reaction of the same nanobubbles.</p></td>

            <p>Conventional polarizers can be classified into three main modes of operation: sheet polarizer using anisotropic absorption media, prism polarizer by refraction and Brewster-angle polarizer by reflection. These polarizing components are not easily integrated with photonic circuits. The in-line fibre polarizer, which relies on polarization-selective coupling between the evanescent field and birefringent crystal or metal, is a promising alternative because of its compatibility with most fibre-optic systems. Here, we demonstrate the operation of a broadband fibre polarizer based on graphene, an ultrathin two-dimensional carbon material. The out-coupled light in the telecommunication band shows a strong s-polarization effect with an extinction ratio of 27 dB. Unlike polarizers made from thin metal film, a graphene polarizer can support transverse-electric-mode surface wave propagation due to its linear dispersion of Dirac electrons.</p></td>

              <p>Ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheets of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are fundamentally and technologically intriguing. In contrast to the graphene sheet, they are chemically versatile. Mono- or few-layered TMDs &mdash; obtained either through exfoliation of bulk materials or bottom-up syntheses &mdash; are direct-gap semiconductors whose bandgap energy, as well as carrier type (n- or p-type), varies between compounds depending on their composition, structure and dimensionality. In this Review, we describe how the tunable electronic structure of TMDs makes them attractive for a variety of applications. They have been investigated as chemically active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and hydrosulfurization, as well as electrically active materials in opto-electronics. Their morphologies and properties are also useful for energy storage applications such as electrodes for Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors.</p></td>
