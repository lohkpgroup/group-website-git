            <p>Ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheets of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are fundamentally and technologically intriguing. In contrast to the graphene sheet, they are chemically versatile. Mono- or few-layered TMDs &mdash; obtained either through exfoliation of bulk materials or bottom-up syntheses &mdash; are direct-gap semiconductors whose bandgap energy, as well as carrier type (n- or p-type), varies between compounds depending on their composition, structure and dimensionality. In this Review, we describe how the tunable electronic structure of TMDs makes them attractive for a variety of applications. They have been investigated as chemically active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and hydrosulfurization, as well as electrically active materials in opto-electronics. Their morphologies and properties are also useful for energy storage applications such as electrodes for Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors.</p></td>

            <p>Graphene oxide, a two-dimensional aromatic scaffold decorated by oxygen-containing functional groups, possesses rich chemical properties and may present a green alternative to precious metal catalysts. Graphene oxide-based carbocatalysis has recently been demonstrated for aerobic oxidative reactions. However, its widespread application is hindered by the need for high catalyst loadings. Here we report a simple chemical treatment that can create and enlarge the defects in graphene oxide and impart on it enhanced catalytic activities for the oxidative coupling of amines to imines (up to 98% yield at 5 wt% catalyst loading, under solvent-free, open-air conditions). This study examines the origin of the enhanced catalytic activity, which can be linked to the synergistic effect of carboxylic acid groups and unpaired electrons at the edge defects. The discovery of a simple chemical processing step to synthesize highly active graphene oxide allows the premise of industrial-scale carbocatalysis to be explored.</p></td>

            <p>Strain engineering has been proposed as an alternative method for manipulating the electronic properties of graphene. However, the bottleneck for strain engineering in graphene has been the ability to control such strain patterns at the nanoscale. Here we show that high level of control can be accomplished by chemically modifying the adherence of graphene on metal. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, the shape evolution of graphene Moir&eacute; blisters towards geometrically well-defined graphene bubbles was studied during the controlled, sub-layer oxidation of the ruthenium substrate. Understanding the dynamics of the oxidation process and defects generation on the Ru substrate allows us to control the size, shape and the density of the bubbles and its associated pseudo-magnetism. We also show that a modification of the same procedure can be used to create antidots in graphene by catalytic reaction of the same nanobubbles.</p></td>

            <p>Conventional polarizers can be classified into three main modes of operation: sheet polarizer using anisotropic absorption media, prism polarizer by refraction and Brewster-angle polarizer by reflection1. These polarizing components are not easily integrated with photonic circuits. The in-line fibre polarizer, which relies on polarization-selective coupling between the evanescent field and birefringent crystal2 or metal3, 4, 5, 6, 7, is a promising alternative because of its compatibility with most fibre-optic systems. Here, we demonstrate the operation of a broadband fibre polarizer based on graphene, an ultrathin two-dimensional carbon material. The out-coupled light in the telecommunication band shows a strong s-polarization effect with an extinction ratio of 27 dB. Unlike polarizers made from thin metal film, a graphene polarizer can support transverse-electric-mode surface wave propagation due to its linear dispersion of Dirac electrons.</p></td>

Cell alignment using printed polydimethylsiloxane  channel arrays on fluorinated graphene further enhances the neuro-induction  of MSCs even in the absence of chemical inducers. The origin of these enhancements was  investigated by studying the surface topography and energies of fluorinated graphene vis-&agrave;-vis unfunctionalized graphene.
